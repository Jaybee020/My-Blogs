My aim is to inspire and educate readers about how I build products using needed technologies(blockahin or/and simple backend frameworks). In these articles, I share practical insights and lessons learnt from my own experience of building. My goal is to network with other tech enthusiasts,spark discussions and contribute to the ecosystem as a whole.
